higher level programming concepts: 
structured programming
unstructured programming
OOPS

OOPS: 

Object oriented programming 

Two building blocks are: CLASS and OBJECT 

CLASS: ITs a collection of attributes and methods that define the behaviour of the object 
object: Instance of a class 

Concepts: 
Abstraction
Polymorphism 
Inheritance 
Enacapsulation 

Aggregation 
Composition 
Association 

ABSTRACTION: Showing essential attributes and hiding "uncessary/irrelevent" implementation details from the users
ex: customer info 
essential: full name, address, SSN, contact number 
uncessary: favorite food, favorite movie, marrital status etc.

It reduces the complexity of the design and allows you to group related classes as sibilings 

Inheritance:
Inheritance allows a class to inherit common properties from other classes

Types: 
Single inheritance 
A <- B 
Multiple inheritance 
A <- B , C <- B
Multilevel inheritance
A <- B <-C
Hierarchical inheritance: one base class has more than one subclasses
vechicle class <- car, van, bike etc.
Hybrid inheritance = Multiple + Multilevel

superclass? BASECLASS - which is a parent class to some other class 
subclasses? child class

Abstract Methods & Abstract Class: 


POLYMORPHISM: Ability of an object/variable/function to take on multiple forms 

1. complile time / static / Method Overloading : possible to give same METHOD NAME to more than one method within a class 
but arguments has to be different 
2. runtime / dynamic / Method overriding : subclass can redefine methods present in parent class but it has to have 
same name, same signature, same return type

Encapsulation:  Binding of data and code together that works as a single unit
ex: CLASS (data specificed in one class is hidden from other class according to the access specifiers)

Access specifiers: It determines accessibilty of methods, classes etc. Implementation of Encapsulation is done by this access modifiers

Name       |	Accessibility from own class|	Accessibility from derived class|	Accessibility from other packages|
Public     | yes | yes | yes |
Private    | yes | no | no |
Protected  | yes | yes | no |
